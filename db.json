      "description": "A surfer rides a wave at Huntington Beach, California. There are four major types of waves. Rolling waves (1) are the most familiar waves, and the type most surfers prefer because they break in a stable pattern. Dumping waves (2) are more unpredictable and are usually limited to experienced surfers. Surging waves (3) are the most dangerous and are most often present on steep or rocky shores. Standing waves (4) are also called stationary waves because they are constant and do not lose strength.",
